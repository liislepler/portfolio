        <p>I had the exciting opportunity to intern as a <b>UI/UX designer</b> at a German start-up, World Simplified. Over the course of four months, I worked with fellow designers all over the world doing <b>user research and developing the website platform</b>. My main task was to design the platform for the desktop view and as well organize the project, taking care of the consistency of the whole platform and giving tasks to other interns in the company.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, I actively contributed to <b>reshaping the company's graphical profile</b>, adding a creative touch to its visual identity.</p>

      <p>The platform offers three user views: client, advisor, and admin. In addition, it features a homepage showcasing services and blog posts.</p>
      <p>All the design work was done on <b>Figma</b>. Prior to this internship, my experience with Figma was limited to university projects. However, working on a larger project with a collaborative team enhanced my appreciation for Figma's dynamic capabilities in UI/UX design.</p>
      <p>Throughout the design process, I contributed to the creation of over 70 screens. Here are a few of the examples.</p>

      <p>Throughout my internship, I worked in close collaboration not only with fellow UI/UX designers but also with web developers handling the website's coding. I gained valuable insights into web design and particularly UI/UX design, and learned how to create user-friendly experiences for a very diverse user base.</p>
      <p>Working alongside creative individuals from around the world was an exciting experience that strengthened my teamwork and communication skills.</p>
