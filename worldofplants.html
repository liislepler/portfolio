      <p>As part of the <b>Client-side Programming</b> course, I was part of developing a game using JavaScript and JavaScript libraries. Inspired by classics like Snakes & Ladders, The Circus Game, and Animal Crossing, we aimed to create a digital board game. Prior to this project, I had grasped the fundamentals of JavaScript and had experimented with smaller games. However, this project pushed me to expand my programming skills significantly.</p>
      <p>During the development process, I delved into Three.js and explored the creation of 3D animated objects for the first time. The game got a lot positive feedback and earned the highest grade.</p>
