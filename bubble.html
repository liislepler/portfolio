        <p>Bubble Garden is a personal project I completed in 4 days, focused on exploring <b>packaging design</b>. Initially, I developed a moodboard, a simple branding guide, and <b>designed the logo</b> for this handmade soap company. Drawing inspiration from my background in illustration—a hobby I've enjoyed for many years—I challenged myself with <b>digital vector illustration</b>, creating the packaging designs using <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> and afterwards designing the full package on <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>. Additionally, I tried out debossing methods for the soap and paid special attention to typography for the label design.</p>
        <p>This project was an enjoyable experience that deepened my passion for graphic design, pattern creation, and experimenting with colors and shapes.</p>
