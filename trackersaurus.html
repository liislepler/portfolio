        <p>Trackersaurus is an activity-tracking application with specialized user levels for parents and children. This project was completed as part of the <b>Applied Web Architecture</b> course. The application's frontend was developed using PHP, connected to the backend through a REST API and a MySQL database. The project follows a structured three-layer architecture: the API, business logic, and presentation layers.</p>
        <p>This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of web development and the organization of scalable programming projects.</p>

      <p>The platform offers signup and login functionalities and each user type has unique <b>CRUD capabilities</b> according to the user type: child or parent.</p>
      <p>For children, these capabilities include creating new logs, updating existing ones, and checking off activities from the assigned to-do list. Parents, on the other hand, can create to-do list activities for each child, and they can also update and delete these activities as needed. Additionally, the platform allows for the deletion of accounts from the database, including all associated children and logs.</p>
