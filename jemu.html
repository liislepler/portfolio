        <p>In March 2024, I started working together with a <b>consulting company, JEMU Solutions, based in Gothenburg, Sweden</b>. My task included <b>redesigning the logo, creating new designs for branding</b> such as logos for the different branches that they specialize in as well as creating the content such as taking photos of the employees. As of now, the branding primarily extends to their LinkedIn profile and presentations for potential clients, yet they are a growing company.</p>
        <p>It has been a very fun and eye-opening journey working together with so many professionals and learning about their experiences as well as bonding with their lovely besökshund Jack!</p>
        <p>Currently, I am also working together with JEMU Solutions’ client <b>UNI5</b>, which is a car racing organization, and I am redesigning their logo and creating other branding materials for promotion.</p>
